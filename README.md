# Beyond the First Question: Conversational RAG 🧠💬

### Short Project Description
Conversational RAG system that upgrades normal RAG into true multi-turn conversational intelligence using memory, history-aware question rewriting, LangGraph session state, and contextual reference resolution — enabling RAG agents to handle vague follow-ups and long horizon context naturally.

---

### Core Capabilities
- Multi-turn vector backed conversational memory  
- History-aware Condense Question step  
- LangGraph based session state machine  
- Follow-up vagueness understanding  
- Entity + pronoun reference grounding

---

### Why this matters
RAG today mostly answers single independent questions.  
This project focuses on moving RAG into production conversational reality — where users speak naturally, implicitly, and expect continuity without repeating context.
